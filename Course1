The entire python bootcamp module and statistics essentials, EDA, git & github, numpy , pandas 

It's been a great journey in learning new concepts like python programming specially numpy and pandas as these are the foundatation for analysis data using a programming language.
I really enjoyed learning EDA the concepts of data cleansing, outliers, skews, IQR, mean mode,univariate and bivariate segmented analysis. These are great concepts.
